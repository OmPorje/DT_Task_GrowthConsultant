# 🚀 DT Fellowship Simulation Assignment – Growth Consultant, 2025

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my submission for the **Growth Consultant Simulation Assignment** as part of the DT Fellowship 2025. The assignment simulates a real-world scenario where you're brought in as a **"Boardroom Therapist meets Growth Scientist"** to help a fast-growing MSME break through its growth ceiling.

---

## 🧠 Assignment Objectives

- Diagnose the **unseen bottleneck** in a growing MSME.
- Design a **theory of change** based on founder insights.
- Propose a **Growth Readiness Scorecard (GRS)** with actionable experiments.
- Use AI prompts to simulate systemic thinking and strategic design.

### 1. **Simulated Founder Transcript**
> A realistic conversation simulating the challenges of an overwhelmed MSME founder.

### 2. **Diagnostic Prompts**
- Mindset-Level: Fear of delegation, overcontrol
- Organizational: Role confusion, hiring breakdowns
- Market Fit: GTM gaps, no growth rhythm
